Modular Design -> Weapon Forging Simulator
This interactive Python program simulates a fantasy weapon-forging experience. Players start by choosing a magical metal—mithril, adamantium, vibranium, or orichalcum—each providing a different power bonus. 
Then, they select a weapon (mace, spear, or hammer) and guess the outcome of a virtual dice roll to determine the weapon's rarity (common, rare, or legendary). 
The program combines the chosen metal's power with rarity bonuses to forge a unique weapon and displays its description at the end.

Text Based Game Project -> Text-Based Adventure Game
Dungeon Tower is a turn-based, text-based RPG where the player ascends through three perilous dungeon floors filled with enemies like zombies, skeletons, and vampires. 
Starting with only a dagger and 10 health, players must fight, block, or heal their way through each level. Earn gold from battles to buy stronger weapons or potions in the shop. 
With only two shield blocks and limited healing, strategic combat is key to defeating the curse of the Forgotten King and claiming victory.
